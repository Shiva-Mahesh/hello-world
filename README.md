# hello-world

Being passionate about computers and coding, I've always wanted to work in the industry. Change in tecnhology is happening in a fast pace, and keeping yourself updated with the current trend has become very essential. Since most of our everyday operations are now connected to our mobile, knowing about web designing and creating web pages has become an important skill. And also, Web designing is an interesting space and I wanted to learn more to build a stronger portfolio.
